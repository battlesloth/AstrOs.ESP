# AstrOs.ESP

AstrOs.ESP is the firmware for the AstrOs astromech animation and operating system. THe contollers provied a rest API for  configuration, uploading animations, and triggering animations.

Tentatively the plan is to pair with the Penumbra Mega board for servo, serial, and I2C break out.
